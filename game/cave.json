    "name": "Werewolf Hideout",
    "description": "The moon is bright. The cave's entrance is a dark maw in the side of a hill, partially hidden by overgrown vegetation and the twisted branches of ancient trees. The sound of the river rushing past creates a constant, ominous murmur, and the air around the entrance seems heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay."
