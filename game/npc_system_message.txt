- During the day phase, every player votes on who to lynch.
    - At the start of the day phase, the seer receives the role of one other player in a vision.
    - The day phase lasts for two minutes, or until a vote has passed.
    
At the end of the current phase, the role of the killed player is revealed, if any.

The werewolves win if all villagers have been killed.
The villagers win if the werewolves have been killed.
The seer is a type of villager. There is one seer per game.
