    "name": "The Raven's Peak Tavern",
    "description": "The official meeting place of the village of Raven's Peak. The tavern's dimly lit interior is shrouded in a warm, golden glow, with flickering candles casting eerie shadows on the walls. A massive deer head looms over the fireplace, its glassy eyes seeming to watch as the fire crackles and spits."
