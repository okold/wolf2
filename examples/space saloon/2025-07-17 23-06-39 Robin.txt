It's hard to keep calm with this headache pounding, but I really don't want to get involved. I just want some peace and quiet.

Mick and Deadeye are both trying to calm things down, and Franklin's trying to talk sense into her. I chimed in to see what's got Sandy all wound up, but she won't budge.

I just want to kick back on this bar stool and forget about the day's troubles, but it seems like we're all wrapped up in Sandy's drama now. Maybe if we can get her to open up, things will settle down. 

I don't mind the others trying to help, but I'd rather be left alone. All I want is a bit of quiet, away from the shouting and stress.

Well, it started with Sandy acting all secretive and determined to get some cash. Everyone, like Franklin, Mick, and Deadeye, was trying to calm her down, offering to help and find another way. I even chimed in to share the burden. But then Sandy snapped, turning it into a full-blown robbery. Ugh, just wanted a quiet night after a hard day in the mines.

I think Mick's got the right idea—the calmer we stay, hopefully, the better this can turn out. I’d like nothing more than to sit here, nurse my drink, and not deal with this nonsense. But if it means looking out for everyone, I guess I'll stay alert, ready to step in if it goes downhill fast.
