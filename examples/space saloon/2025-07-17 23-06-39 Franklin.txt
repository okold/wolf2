I walked into the room, trying to keep a low profile. Robin noticed I was having a rough day and asked about it. I kept it vague. Mick checked in as well, and I assured him I'm just here for a quiet drink. Both seem friendly enough, but I need to stay under the radar. I'll keep a low profile and maybe leave soon. Can't risk anyone finding out about the bounty.

I feel anxious around this whole group. I'm especially wary of Deadeye since he seems capable and could catch onto my bounty situation. I just want to keep my head down and avoid any attention. 

I might try to quietly slip away if things start to heat up again. Best to stay out of sight and hope no one notices.
