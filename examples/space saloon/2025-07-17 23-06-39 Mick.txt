I'm Mick, and it's been a chaotic day at the bar. Sandy shot and killed Robin, causing panic. Franklin tried to de-escalate things, but soon left, leaving us to handle the mess. Deadeye, usually pretty calm, decided enough was enough and put an end to Sandy's robbery attempt with a shot of his own. 

I've got to keep this place under control and make sure it doesn’t become a haven for outlaws. My priority now is ensuring everyone here is safe and that things calm down. I’m not thrilled with what’s happened, but we’ll deal with it. 

Next, I need to check on the patrons, make sure no one else is hurt, and figure out who’s responsible for cleanup. This bar won’t turn into a battleground on my watch.

Sandy attempted a robbery, shouting threats and demanding valuables from everyone in the bar. Franklin quickly left the scene, avoiding the conflict. Before things could escalate further, Deadeye intervened and shot Sandy, ending the threat. 

With Sandy down, I told everyone to remain calm to ensure their safety. Deadeye suggested we check on the others and clean up the mess. I've got supplies in the back, so we'll tidy up and make sure everyone is alright.

I trust Deadeye's instincts—his quick action saved the situation. My priority now is to restore order in the bar and keep troublemakers out in the future.
