2025-07-17 23:10:05,829 - INFO - Sandy created a summary:
Alright, here's what's happened. I told Robin we didn't need a breather—just a distraction from the real goal. But things escalated fast, and I ended up shooting Robin. Now Robin's out of the picture.

Deadeye tried talking sense into me, thinking there's another way. Ha! He doesn't get it, does he? This is the only way that works for me. Franklin chimed in too, trying to calm things down. Too late, Franklin. This is a robbery, and I'm committed.

Deadeye's been keeping an eye on me, thinking he can control this situation. Well, he can't. I've made it clear to everyone: start emptying those pockets or else. I'm on edge, but this is what I live for.

Next step? Make sure they comply—and quickly. I'm not afraid to shoot again if someone tries to test me. I've got to get that loot and be the one in charge here, no matter what.
