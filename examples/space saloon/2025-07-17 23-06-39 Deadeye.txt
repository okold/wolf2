Things got intense fast. Sandy’s storming in, demanding cash, no backing down. Got Mick and Robin trying to simmer things down, and Franklin wants everyone to step back. I'm caught between helping de-escalate and thinking about that potential payday if I play my cards right. Sandy’s desperate, and where there's desperation, there's often opportunity.

Next move? I'll try to extract more info from Sandy while looking for an angle that scores me a payday. Maybe I can help out without blowing this whole thing to pieces. Time to tread carefully but keep my eyes on the prize. Let's see what comes out of Sandy about that cash.

I'm Deadeye, and things got heated when Sandy demanded cash, threatening to escalate things. Mick, Robin, and Franklin tried to calm the situation, urging Sandy to talk and offering help. I echoed their sentiment, hoping to find a peaceful solution. Despite my bold nature, I don't want unnecessary trouble. 

I'm keeping an eye on Sandy's intentions, but everyone's efforts to de-escalate are noted. I need to stay sharp—this could be an opportunity or lead to a bounty. I should explore options for profit while keeping the peace. 

Next, I'll try to assess Sandy's desperation and see if there's a bounty angle here.

Well, things got heated real quick. Franklin was trying to keep it calm, suggesting we step back, but he bailed when things went south. Mick was shouting for cover and trying to get Sandy to stand down. 

When Sandy made it clear she was serious about the robbery, it was my cue. I took the shot and hit her. She’s down for good now. Mick is handling the crowd, making sure everyone's safe.

I’ve got my eyes on the prize—collecting that bounty on Sandy. But first, I should help Mick wrap things up here. After that, it's time to hit the road and find the next job. Always another bounty out there.

Mick and I were tackling some cleanup together, appreciating the teamwork. Mick's grateful for the help and advises me to stay clear of trouble as I hunt for bounties. He seems to have everything under control on his end, and I trust him to keep things in line.

I like Mick—reliable and level-headed, a good person to have on your side. As for me, I'm itching to find new bounties and fatten my pockets. I'll keep an ear to the ground and make sure any trouble I find doesn't catch me off guard.

My next move? Finish up here and start scouting for leads. Bounties won't catch themselves.
