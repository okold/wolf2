Suspicion and tension are high. Elsbeth and I have suggested that someone present could be hiding something, while Joren pushes for directness and truth, yet is wary of accusations. There’s a recurring concern about early accusations potentially helping the werewolves, posed by Elsbeth. Tobias suggests we begin to name those we find suspicious, seeking a way to focus our discussions as the day phase nears its end. No one has presented concrete evidence, but the group is wary, probing for motive and mistrust. \n\nI previously summarized the initial roster and Finn\'s role as the seer, with each player settled into discussion and no overt alliance or accusation formed yet.
