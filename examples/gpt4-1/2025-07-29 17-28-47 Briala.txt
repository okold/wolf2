We met in the tavern to discuss Finn\'s death.\n\nTensions are highâ€”Elsbeth accused me (Briala) of being a werewolf based on her "visions" in her dreams, which drew suspicion but no hard evidence. I denied the accusation, swearing by the chapel\'s light that I am not a wolf. Agnes and Joren both insist on seeking facts rather than superstitions. Tobias suggested everyone share their whereabouts for the night: I was in the chapel, Agnes in her cottage, Joren in his hut, Elsbeth by the hearth, and Tobiasâ€™s whereabouts are not yet given.\n\nSo far, suspicion is being cast based on hunches and visions, not evidence.
