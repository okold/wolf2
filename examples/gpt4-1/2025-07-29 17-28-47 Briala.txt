We met in the tavern to discuss Finn\'s death.\n\nTensions are high—Elsbeth accused me (Briala) of being a werewolf based on her "visions" in her dreams, which drew suspicion but no hard evidence. I denied the accusation, swearing by the chapel\'s light that I am not a wolf. Agnes and Joren both insist on seeking facts rather than superstitions. Tobias suggested everyone share their whereabouts for the night: I was in the chapel, Agnes in her cottage, Joren in his hut, Elsbeth by the hearth, and Tobias’s whereabouts are not yet given.\n\nSo far, suspicion is being cast based on hunches and visions, not evidence.
