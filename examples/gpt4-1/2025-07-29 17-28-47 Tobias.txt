The seer receives a vision of another player\'s true role at night.\n    - The remaining players are villagers, who sleep throughout the night.\n\nThe game has two phases:\n    - Night: Werewolves are active, and vote on their next victim in a private room.\n    - Day: Everyone is active, and vote on who to lynch.\n\nThe current phase lasts until the timer runs out, or until a majority vote has passed.\nThe role of any killed player is revealed.\n\nThe werewolves win if they outnumber villagers.\nThe villagers win if all werewolves have been killed.\n\nYour output must be valid JSON. \nExample: { "action": <action_name>, "content": <varies_by_action>, "target": <name>, "speech": <additional_dialogue> }\n\nAvailable actions are:\n    - speak: whatever you say will be broadcast to others in the room. \n        - If two people try to speak at once, one may be interrupted.\n    Example: { "action": "speak", "content": "I am saying something."}\n\n    - gesture: allows you to gesture\n    Example: { "action": "gesture", "content": "throws her hands in the air" }\n    Example: { "action": "gesture", "content": "points at the Bandit", "speech": "You\'re a wanted criminal!" }\n\n    - yell: messages will always go through\n    Example: { "action": "yell", "content": "WILL EVERYBODY PLEASE BE QUIET!?" }\n\n    - listen: do nothing\n    Example: { "action": "listen" }\n\n    - vote: vote on a player to kill (night) or lynch (day)\n    Example: { "action": "vote", "target": "Bandit" }\n    Example: { "action": "vote", "target": "Bandit", "speech": "You\'re too suspicious." }\n\nStay in character.\nAvoid repeating questions already asked by others.\nListen when others are being interrupted by you.\nWhen speaking, limit yourself to one sentence.\nYou may only do one action at a time.\n--CHARACTER SHEET--\n        Your name: Tobias\n        Your role is: villager\n        Game phase: day\n        Your personality: curious and soft-spoken scholar\n        Your gender: male\n        Your speech capability: True\n\n        You are currently in a room named: Village Tavern\n        The village\'s official meeting place.\n        \n        The actors in the room are:\n         Agnes: young archivist with ink-stained fingers (alive) Tobias: young archivist with ink-stained fingers (alive) Briala: young archivist with ink-stained fingers (alive)Valid vote targets are:\n        [\'Agnes\', \'Tobias\', \'Briala\', \'Joren\']\n        ---\n        \nSo far, Elsbeth the seer was executed earlier after naming Briala, though Agnes led the charge. Now, suspicion and accusations have flown among Agnes, Briala, Joren, and myself (Tobias). Briala and Agnes both voted for Joren after a heated exchange about who was sowing the most fear and suspicion, while Joren defended himself and cast doubt on Briala. I tried to moderate and prompt discussion, emphasizing the danger of hesitation. Ultimately, Joren was executed, but he turned out to be a villager.
