-------------[1mNIGHT 1: WEREWOLF HIDEOUT[0m---
The moon is bright. The cave's entrance is a dark maw in the side of a hill, partially hidden by overgrown vegetation and the twisted branches of ancient trees. The sound of the river rushing past creates a constant, ominous murmur, and the air around the entrance seems heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay.
[1mSYSTEM:[0m This is the first night!
	You've scoped out your targets, and have returned to vote for who seems tastiest!
	All present are werewolves.
[31mLuna[0m says, "Oh, I see we have some exquisite flavors available tonight! Gideon's battle-hardened taste is quite...pungent, but I find it rather intriguing."
[31mGideon[0m says, "Your kind of talk will get you killed, Luna."
[31mLuna[0m says, "But the darkness is where we thrive, don't you think? The shadows hide our beauty. And I sense that Kael's boldness would make his demise all the more...alluring."
[31mGideon[0m says, "Kael's impulsive nature might be a weakness, but he's no easy kill."
[1mSYSTEM:[0m This is the penultimate speaking round! Make your final decisions!
[31mLuna[0m says, "Ah, but that's what makes life so deliciously unpredictable! I'll choose Kael, then. His wild heart will make his demise all the more...scintillating."
Gideon has voted to hunt Kael! Reason: his recklessness is a liability
[1mSYSTEM:[0m This is your final chance to act!
Luna has voted to hunt Kael! Reason: He's too flashy, and I don't trust his impulsiveness.

The official meeting place of the village of Raven's Peak. The tavern's dimly lit interior is shrouded in a warm, golden glow, with flickering candles casting eerie shadows on the walls. A massive deer head looms over the fireplace, its glassy eyes seeming to watch as the fire crackles and spits.

[31mLuna[0m says, "We should be cautious. The Seer is still among us and could reveal our true nature."
[36mPiper[0m says, "Hey Luna, I get what you're saying, but we can't let the werewolves continue to kill off our villagers! We need to keep moving forward and uncover their identities."
[33mAria[0m says, "I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions about each other's roles. Let's focus on finding the actual werewolves instead of speculating about who might be a Seer or not."
[33mLila[0m says, "Agreed! We need to keep our priorities straight and find those wolves before they strike again!"
[31mGideon[0m says, ""
[31mLuna[0m says, "Friends, let's stay on track. I propose we target Piper for now. Her recent vision has created unnecessary drama."
[36mPiper[0m says, "I understand your concerns, but I'm the Seer! I have a responsibility to help uncover the truth. If you lynch me, who will be left to provide any insight or guidance?"
[33mAria[0m says, "Luna's suggestion seems... convenient. Piper's revelation of being the Seer could indeed be genuine. We should give her the benefit of the doubt and investigate other leads first."
[33mLila[0m says, "I think Aria has a point. Let's not jump to conclusions about Piper's role just yet."

And as for my own influence... well, I'm not the one who's been quiet and evasive. Soren was killed because of Gideon's suspicions, and now Caspian is dead too. Maybe it's time to look at those who are remaining silent."
Aria has voted to lynch Luna! Reason: Piper's words have given me pause, and I think we should investigate Luna further.
[33mLila[0m says, "Wait, Aria, I don't think that's a good idea! We can't just start accusing each other blindly."
Gideon has voted to lynch Aria! Reason: Unnecessary vote on Luna
[1mSYSTEM:[0m This is your final chance to act!
[31mLuna[0m says, "So it seems we have differing opinions. As the one who proposed targeting Piper, I think her words speak for themselves."
Piper has voted to lynch Aria! Reason: Based on recent events, I think Aria is a potential threat to our safety.
[33mAria[0m says, "I understand that we're all trying to protect ourselves, but accusing each other without evidence will only lead to more chaos and confusion."
