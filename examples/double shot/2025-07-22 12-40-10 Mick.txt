Served whiskey, drew on Sandy and mortally wounded him, but was himself killed in the exchange. I’ll note he was trigger-happy but on my side.\n\n• Franklin – drifter passing through, asked about work, bought a round, then left peacefully. Harmless; could visit again.\n\n• Sandy the Outlaw – barged in, demanded wallets, shot Robin, was shot by Robin and dropped dead on my floor. Outlaws get no quarter.\n\n• Deadeye – just entered after the gunfight. Unknown intentions. Could be trouble.\n\nNext steps I’ll take:\n\n1. Secure the scene and bodies—keep other patrons calm.  \n2.
