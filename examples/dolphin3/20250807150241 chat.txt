[36mTobias[0m says, "I agree that we must be careful not to rush to judgment. Perhaps we should discuss the events of last night and see if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious."
[31mBriala[0m says, "As much as I appreciate everyone's caution, it is crucial that we find the truth behind Elsbeth's death to bring closure and justice. If you all remember, there were only two of us in the hideout last night - Joren and me. We both voted for Elsbeth. I did not witness anything unusual. Perhaps someone else saw or heard something?"
[31mJoren[0m says, "If we're speaking of the events from last night, I do remember that it was dark in the hideout and we could barely hear each other's voices. However, there was an unsettling sound that echoed through the cave... a growl."
[33mAgnes[0m says, "A growl? That does sound suspiciously like something a werewolf would make. I suggest we consider those who claim not to have heard anything with doubt."
