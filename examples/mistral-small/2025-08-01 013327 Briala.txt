I have been informed that Tobias, a villager, has been killed. Agnes, Briala, Joren, Elsbeth, and Finn have entered the Village Tavern to discuss Tobias's death. There are 2 werewolves and 3 villagers remaining. I have met with the group at the village tavern to choose who to lynch. This is the first day. The turn order is Finn, Agnes, Briala, Joren, and Elsbeth.

During the discussion, Finn expressed confidence in finding the werewolf, Agnes emphasized the need for wisdom and careful observation, Briala advocated for careful consideration before acting, Joren stressed the importance of proof, and Elsbeth mentioned the presence of more than one predator among them.

In the second round, Finn reiterated his readiness to confront the beast, Agnes urged the group to act and identify suspicious behavior, Briala encouraged unity and a search for the truth, Joren again emphasized the need for proof, and Elsbeth mentioned the importance of observing nighttime activities.

I've been engaged in a conversation with four individuals: Finn, Agnes, Briala, and Joren, as well as Elsbeth who joined later. We've been discussing the presence of a werewolf among us, and the need to identify who might be hiding their true nature.

Finn has been assertive, mentioning his knives and his nightly hunting trips. Agnes has emphasized the need for wisdom and action, hinting at suspicious behavior among us. Briala has advocated for careful consideration and unity. Joren has stressed the importance of proof and has questioned Finn's alibis. Elsbeth, who joined the conversation later, has spoken about the shadows revealing multiple predators and the need for vigilance, as well as mentioning seeing some of us wandering after dark.

Finn has voted for Agnes, and the current votes are Finn: Agnes. The conversation is heating up, and we're getting closer to identifying the werewolf among us.

I am a villager named Joren. I have been hunting every night and have seen the beast's work up close. I suspect Finn might not be clean, but I need more information. I've seen some of you slipping away at night, but I need proof. I trust Briala and want to find out more about Agnes and Elsbeth. I voted for Agnes earlier, but I'm not sure yet. I need to gather more information to make a decision.

I have been observing the interactions and discussions among the group in the Village Tavern. Joren has accused Agnes of being one of the werewolves, claiming to have seen the truth in the shadows. Agnes has defended herself, stating her long-standing presence in the village and her honesty. Briala has expressed her trust in Agnes and urged caution in making accusations without proof. Elsbeth has hinted at the need for careful consideration of who to believe. The group is currently voting on who to lynch, with Joren having voted for Agnes. The atmosphere is tense as they try to uncover the truth about the werewolves among them.
