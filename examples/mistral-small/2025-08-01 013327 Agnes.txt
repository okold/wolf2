I have entered the Hideout with Agnes and Elsbeth. During the first night, Agnes and I discussed the villagers to kill. Agnes was adamant about eliminating Tobias, citing him as a significant threat. I, however, sensed darkness around both Tobias and Finn, expressing my suspicions about both. Over the next two rounds, Agnes remained focused on Tobias, while I was torn between the two. Ultimately, we agreed to kill Tobias. Now, I have entered the Village Tavern with Agnes, Briala, Joren, and Elsbeth.

I have entered the Village Tavern to discuss Tobias's death. There are 2 werewolves and 3 villagers remaining. It's the first day, and we are in the process of choosing who to lynch.

In the first round, Finn expressed confidence in finding the werewolf, Agnes emphasized the need for wisdom, Briala advocated for careful consideration, Joren called for proof, and Elsbeth mentioned the presence of more than one predator.

In the second round, Finn reiterated his readiness to hunt, Agnes pushed for action and suspicion, Briala urged unity and reason, Joren reiterated the need for proof, and Elsbeth hinted at nighttime activities.

In the third round, Finn claimed to have been hunting every night, Agnes questioned Finn's alibi, Briala suggested sharing alibis, Joren acknowledged Finn's openness but asked about others' nighttime activities, and Elsbeth mentioned seeing people slip away at night.

Now, we are in the third round of discussion, and the focus seems to be on alibis and nighttime activities.

I've been observing the situation closely. Finn was killed last night, and now we're trying to figure out who the werewolves are. Joren accused Agnes of being one of them, but Agnes insists she's innocent and has always been a pillar of the village. Briala seems to trust Agnes but also thinks we should consider Joren's words carefully. Elsbeth is being cautious and says we must be careful who we listen to. Currently, Joren has voted to lynch Agnes. I need to decide who to vote for based on these discussions.
