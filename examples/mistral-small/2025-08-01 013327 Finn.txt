I have been updated with information about the villagers and their statements regarding Tobias's death. There are 2 werewolves and 3 villagers remaining. The villagers present are Finn, Agnes, Briala, Joren, and Elsbeth. Each has expressed their thoughts on the situation, with Finn and Agnes advocating for action, Briala and Joren emphasizing the need for proof and unity, and Elsbeth mentioning the importance of vigilance and observing nighttime activities. The group is currently discussing who to lynch.

I've been facilitating a discussion among four individuals: Agnes, Finn, Briala, Joren, and Elsbeth. They are trying to identify who among them is a werewolf. Here's a summary of their interactions:

1. **First Round:**
   - Agnes emphasizes the need for wisdom and asks who is hiding their true nature.
   - Briala advocates for careful consideration and unity.
   - Joren stresses the importance of proof over mere words.
   - Elsbeth warns of multiple predators and the need for vigilance.

2. **Second Round:**
   - Finn offers his knives and challenges others to reveal themselves.
   - Agnes pushes for action and asks about suspicious behavior.
   - Briala urges against baseless accusations and promotes unity.
   - Joren reiterates the need for proof and asks about reasons to hide.
   - Elsbeth questions who has been seen wandering at night.

3. **Third Round:**
   - Finn admits to nightly hunting and asks for alibis from others.
   - Agnes suggests Finn might be covering his tracks.
   - Briala asks for alibis and urges against jumping to conclusions.
   - Joren questions Finn's alibi and asks about others' nighttime activities.
   - Elsbeth mentions seeing people slip away at night.

4. **Fourth Round:**
   - Agnes hints at knowing who lurks in the shadows but doesn't name anyone.
   - Briala expresses trust in Agnes but cautions against fear-driven divisions.

Throughout the discussion, Finn has voted for Agnes as the werewolf. The group is trying to gather information and evidence to identify the werewolf among them.
