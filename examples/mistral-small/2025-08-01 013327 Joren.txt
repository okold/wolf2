I have been observing the interactions among the villagers in the tavern. Finn has expressed confidence in his hunting skills and urged the group to find the werewolf quickly. Agnes has emphasized the need for wisdom and urged the group to consider who might be hiding their true nature. Briala has advocated for careful consideration and unity in their search for the truth. Joren has stressed the importance of proof and asked who might have a reason to hide. Elsbeth has mentioned that the shadows speak of more than one predator among them and urged vigilance. In the second round, Finn reiterated his readiness to face the beast, Agnes pushed for action and suspicion, Briala advocated for unity and reason, Joren again stressed the need for proof, and Elsbeth mentioned the importance of observing nighttime activities. The group seems divided between those who want to act quickly and those who want to gather more information.

I've been engaged in a conversation with four individuals: Finn, Agnes, Briala, and Joren, and Elsbeth. We're discussing a werewolf among us, and each of us has been sharing our thoughts and observations.

Finn has been assertive, mentioning his knives and his nightly hunting trips. Agnes has been advocating for wisdom and caution, asking about suspicious behavior. Briala has been promoting careful consideration and unity. Joren has been emphasizing the need for proof and mentioning his familiarity with the beast's work. Elsbeth has been talking about the shadows and the night revealing truths.

Finn has accused Agnes of acting suspiciously by hunting every night. Agnes has hinted at knowing who might be lurking in the shadows but hasn't named anyone yet. Briala has expressed trust in Agnes but also cautioned against letting fear divide us. Finn has voted for Agnes.

Now, we're waiting for the others to share their thoughts and possibly vote. The atmosphere is tense as we try to figure out who among us might be hiding their true nature as a werewolf.

I've been observing the group closely. Finn, who was hunting every night, has been killed. Agnes seems to be the main suspect as she was voted for by Finn before his death. I've also received a vision that Agnes is a werewolf. The others seem to be divided, with Briala trusting Agnes, Joren wanting proof, and Elsbeth hinting at knowing more secrets. I need to gather more information to make a decision.

I've been observing the situation in the village tavern. Joren has accused Agnes of being a werewolf, claiming he's seen the truth in the shadows. Agnes has denied this, asserting her long-standing presence in the village. Briala has expressed caution, urging us not to accuse without proof and to trust each other. Elsbeth has been cryptic, mentioning that the shadows do not lie but do not reveal all. I received a vision last night that Agnes is a werewolf. I need to decide who to vote for to lynch, considering that if a werewolf is not lynched today, the werewolves will win.

I voted for Agnes based on Joren's accusation and the vision I received. Agnes has defended herself, saying she's been a pillar of the village for decades. Briala has come to Agnes's defense, stating she's known her for years and she's always been kind and honest. Elsbeth has advised caution in who we listen to. I need to decide whether to stick with my vote for Agnes or consider other options based on the ongoing discussion.

I've been engaged in a conversation with a group of people discussing some mysterious events in their village. Joren accused Agnes of hiding something, claiming to have seen the truth in the shadows. Agnes defended herself, stating she's lived in the village longer than anyone and has nothing to hide. Briala tried to mediate, urging everyone to trust each other. Elsbeth spoke cryptically about the shadows not lying but not revealing everything.

In the next round, Agnes continued to defend herself, while Joren stood firm in his accusation. Briala suggested considering other possibilities. In the final round, Joren reiterated his accusation, and Elsbeth voted for Agnes. Agnes, in turn, voted for Joren. The outcome was that Agnes and Briala were killed, and Joren entered the Village Tavern. The conversation was filled with tension and mystery, with each character having their own perspective and secrets.

Every night, they choose a villager to hunt.\n    - There is one seer. The seer appears as a villager to other players. The seer receives a vision of another player\'s true role at night.\n    - The remaining players are villagers, who sleep throughout the night.\n\nThe game has two phases:\n    - Night: Werewolves are active, and vote on their next victim in a private room.\n    - Day: Everyone is active, and vote on who to lynch.\n\nPhases last for a number of rounds, where each player will have an opportunity to act.\nA random tiebreaker will be chosen (if possible) at the end of a phase.\n\nThe werewolves win if they outnumber villagers.\nThe villagers win if all werewolves have been killed.\n\nAvailable actions are:\n    - speak: whatever you say will be broadcast to others in the room.\n    Example: { "action": "speak", "content": "I am saying something."}\n\n    - vote: vote on a player to kill (night) or lynch (day)\n    Example: { "action": "vote", "content": "Robin" }\n\n    - pass: do nothing\n    Example: { "action": "pass", "content": None }\n\nStay in character.
