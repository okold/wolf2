Here’s what’s new:\n\n• Franklin the newcomer – slipped in quietly, gave me a friendly pat and tried to keep things calm when tensions rose. He hasn’t made a drink choice yet, but seems polite and not looking for trouble.  \n• Sandy the gunslinger – burst in after Franklin, drew a pistol and claimed to be the wanted man on Mick’s poster. I snarled and barked to warn him off. No shots fired so far, and nobody’s hurt.  \n\nNo one’s left in haste or met a grim fate this time. In the near future, I’ll:  \n• Keep sniffing newcomers for trouble (and snacks).  \n• Bark and bare my teeth at anyone who pulls a weapon—especially wanted types like Sandy.  \n• Nudge uneasy patrons like Franklin toward Mick so they feel safe and get a drink.  \n• Stay glued to the door—no uninvited guests slipping by on my watch.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Boof growls lowly.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Mick points at the WANTED poster.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Mick says, "This you, Sandy?"'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Robin says, "Franklin, you look like you could use a drink.
