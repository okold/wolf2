He knows my order before I do and will keep the hard stuff coming.  \n• Boof – my faithful dog, ever at my side, ready to sniff out trouble (and friends).  \n• Franklin – just wandered in for “a quiet drink,” still hesitating on the Supernova Slosher I’ve been pushing.  \n• Sandy – just burst in, drew a pistol, and claims the wanted poster is him. Hotheaded and dangerous, threatening Mick—and by extension me.  \n• Deadeye – slipped in behind Sandy. No idea whose side he’s on yet.\n\nNo one’s left or died so far, but things are about to blow.  \n\nWhat I think:  \n• Sandy’s trouble — wants to make a name with his gun, but he’s overreached by pulling it in my bar.  \n• Franklin’s still shy about ordering; a stiff drink may calm him.  \n• Deadeye could tip the scales if he’s packing too.\n\nNear-term plan:  \n1. Defuse or dominate the showdown with Sandy before someone gets shot.  \n2. Keep nudging Franklin toward that Supernova Slosher – the stronger the better for knocking sense (and pain) out of him.  \n3.
