Here’s what’s happened and who’s left standing:\n\n• Franklin: A jittery peacekeeper—keeps trying to calm me and the others. He’s still alive, sipping nervously on a Supernova Slosher.  \n• Robin: The barkeep—warned me to stand down, but I’ve got no use for threats. She’s still behind the bar, weighing her options.  \n• Mick: Saloon owner and self-appointed sheriff—ordered me to holster or face consequences. I’ve already fired at him (next shot’s coming). He’s alive but on his last breath.  \n• Boof: Mick’s vicious guard dog—barking orders to take me down. He’s still growling at my heels.  \n• Deadeye: Bounty hunter with a 50-million-credit target on my head—took a bullet from me and is dead on the floor.\n\nWhat I think: Franklin is weak; Robin’s bark is worse than her bite; Mick and Boof are obstacles to be eliminated. Deadeye’s corpse is a reminder that I don’t bluff.\n\nNext moves:  \n1. Finish off Mick before he can draw.  \n2. Neutralize Boof or send him running.  \n3. Decide whether to use the bounty on me by collecting Frank and Robin as hostages—or just burn this place down and ride out with the cash.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Mick says, "Enough, Sandy.
